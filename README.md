# A Education Exam System for A Event [Name: Dig The Data 3.0]

This project is a **Event And Exam Management System** designed for educational or competitive environments, such as university departments, hackathons, or online quiz competitions. It allows teams to participate in quizzes, answer questions, request hints, and track their scores. The system is built using **Django**, a Python web framework, and includes features for user authentication, team management, quiz administration, and score tracking.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **User Authentication and Team Management**:
   - Users can register and log in.
   - Each user is associated with a team, and teams can have multiple members.
   - Teams can be created, and team members can be added with details like name, position, class ID, WhatsApp number, email, and department.

2. **Quiz Management**:
   - Admins can create quizzes and mark them as active or inactive.
   - Questions can be added to quizzes, with options for common questions (shared across teams) or unique questions (specific to a team).
   - Questions can include links (e.g., to external resources) and have correct answers.

3. **Answer Submission and Scoring**:
   - Teams can submit answers to questions.
   - Answers are automatically checked against the correct answer, and scores are calculated.
   - Common questions are worth 10 points, while unique questions are worth 20 points.

4. **Hint System**:
   - Teams can request hints for questions.
   - Admins can fulfill hint requests and notify teams.

5. **Score Tracking**:
   - Scores for each team are tracked and displayed.
   - Admins can view and manage scores.

6. **Site Settings**:
   - Admins can control whether registration and login are open or closed.

7. **User and Team Profiles**:
   - Users have profiles with personal details.
   - Teams have profiles with team members and their details.
